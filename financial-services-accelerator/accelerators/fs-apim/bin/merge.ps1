#   If your accelerator is located inside of the base product you can just call .\merge.ps1

#   Please note that these powershell files are not digitally signed yet. So, powershell will not allow these scripts under any of their execution policies.
#   You may need to run these scripts on an execution policy bypassed powershell instance. You can do that using the following command.
#       powershell.exe -executionpolicy bypass <SCRIPT_FILEPATH>

# Get the current working directory of the powershell session, so we can set to this directory after the script finishes.
